## Club del Sur - Manifesto

There comes a time when a city is ripe for change.
We are seeing it in ours.
Punta del Este is a city with the perfect blend of rural lifestyle, wellness, and quality.
With its beautiful nature and slow life, it has attracted the best minds, builders, and entrepreneurs from the region.
Once a vacationing destination, it is now the home of many people living all year round.
In this city, you can find world-class art, exquisite restaurants and great nightlife But while many entertainment activities are available, there are no activities that challenge the mind.
We crave stimulating conversations

This is a problem bigger than us.
In today's world, there is no time for deep conversations.
Society is more concerned with lifestyle and leisure, leaving no space nor time for deep explorations.
We live in a society that asigns more value to how things look than their real quality.
We judge people by their job titles, certificates and wealth.
We compare people by their followers' counts, likes, or views.
We waste out time entertaining ourselves, but we are more bored and anxious than ever.
We are addicted to the dopamine our phones feeds us.
Why are we still trapped in these games?

On top of that, we face another problem.
While our technologies made our lives easier and more comfortable, that comfort is fragmenting our communities.
Why would we want to invest in a community if all our necessities can be solved within 3 clicks? From the comfort of our homes, we can buy goods and food and get them delivered to our doors.
We get to see and chat with our friends and family all the time, from everywhere.
We can work, take classes, and excersise online.
But this lifestyle of comfort comes with secondary effects  It is disconnecting us from what truly makes us feel alive.
We are loosing our social abilities and connections.

We evolved as social creatures.
We are spending too much time online.
We are spending too much time alone.
Most people don’t know their neighbors, less so, trust them.

Our lives are getting shallow and faster but without real substance.
We are everywhere, but we are nowhere at the same time.
We are connected with everyone but we are not connecting with our friends.
We are entertained but we are not living a life of meaning.
We look like we are having a good moment, but we are more isolated than ever.
We need face-to-face interactions.
We need spaces to gather and share experiences together.
And we need them in a regular basis.

Wellness and holistic solutions are blooming.
But they are solutions focused on the individual, not the community.
Our community health is as important as our phisycal one.
People are looking for connection.
We see new efforts all over the world of new communities emerging.
Looking for reinvindicating a knwologe not so long forgottedn.
We are here to join that revolution

We see the opportunity awaiting.

In this contex, Club del Sur was born.
We are a group of dreamers and builders who want to restore the social fabrics that are so important for the individual and society as a whole.
Our mision is to bridge the physical and mental gaps that separate us.
We aim to create environments that go beyond mere entertainment.
We want to reinvindiacte the value of a strong community.
We want to restore the safe spaces where we can regularly meet and create.
We are creating a playground where we can truly connect with others who inspire us, have meaningful conversations, and experiment with new ideas.
A space where dialogue and ideas unfold and flourish.


In a world where you can talk with everyone from anywhere in the world.
We choose phisical connection, stability and routine.
We believe in the power of traditions and having a physical space where you can connect in person with others.
We don’t host standalone events nor virtual events.
All meetings happen on a regular and in-person basis.
We also believe in the power of working in person with others.
We value critical thinking, dialogue, curiosity, and action.

Our city is more than a place for leisure now.
Our community is ready for it’s new ...
At Club del Sur, we welcome you and the other dreamers who want to build the culture for today and for those who are still to come.
