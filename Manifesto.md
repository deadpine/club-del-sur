## Club del Sur - Manifesto

There comes a time when a town is ripe for change.
We are seeing it in ours.
Jose Ignacio is a town with the perfect blend of rural lifestyle, wellness, and luxury.
With its beautiful nature and slow life, it has attracted the best minds, builders, and entrepreneurs from the region.
In this town, you can find world-class art, exquisite restaurants and great nightlife
But while entertainment activities abound, there are no activities that challenge the mind.
We crave stimulating conversations

This problem is bigger than our town.
These days society is more concerned with lifestyle and leisure.
We are being trapped by our comfort.
Our lives are getting shallow and faster but without substance.
Our technologies are disconnecting us.
We are everywhere, but we are nowhere at the same time.
We are spending too much time online.
We are spending too much time alone.
There is no time for deep conversations.
There is no time for deep explorations.

We see the opportunity awaiting.

This is how Club del Sur was born.
Our vision is to bridge the physical and mental gaps that separate us.
We aim to create environments that go beyond mere entertainment.
We are creating a playground where we can connect with others who inspire us, have meaningful conversations, and experiment.
A space where ideas can unfold and flourish.
We don’t host standalone events.
All events happen on a regular basis.
We don’t host virtual events.
All events are in person.
We value critical thinking, dialogue, curiosity, and action.
We believe in the power of working face-to-face on complex problems.

Jose Ignacio is ready. We are ready.
This town is more than a place for leisure now.
