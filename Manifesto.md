## Club del Sur - Manifesto

There comes a time when a city is ripe for change.
We are seeing it in ours.
Punta del Este is a city with the perfect blend of rural lifestyle, wellness, and quality.
With its beautiful nature and slow life, it has attracted the best minds, builders, and entrepreneurs from the region.
Once a vacationing destination, it is now the home of many people living all year round.
Here, you can find world-class art, exquisite restaurants and great nightlife But while there are many entertainment activities, there are no activities that challenge the mind.
We crave stimulating conversations

This problem is bigger than us.
In today's world, society is more concerned with lifestyle and leisure, leaving no space nor time for deep conversations.
It is hard to think when we live in reactive mode.
It is even harder when we are being exposed to the amount of information and noise as we are today, we are left with no time to process, only to consume.
Ideas need focus, space and time to unfold.
To be still, to think critically, is an act of defiance today.

We live in a society that asigns more value to how things look than their inner quality.
We judge people by their job titles, certificates and wealth.
We compare them by their followers' counts, likes, or views.
We are addicted to the dopamine our screens feeds us.
 We are everywhere, and nowhere at the same time.
We are connected to everyone but not connecting with them.
We waste our time entertaining ourselves, but we are more bored and anxious than ever.
Our lives are getting shallow and faster but without substance.
Why are we still trapped in these games? 

If that wasn’t enough, we face another problem.
While our technologies made our lives easier and more comfortable, that comfort is fragmenting our communities.
Why would we invest in a community if all our necessities can be solved within 3 clicks? From the comfort of our homes, we can buy goods and food and get them delivered to our doors.
We get to chat with our friends all the time, from everywhere.
We can work, take classes, and excersise online.
But this lifestyle of comfort is disconnecting us from what truly makes us feel alive, we are loosing our social skills.
For centuries we evolved around social structures that allowed us to build the world we live today.
We learnt to trust other community members and coordinate with them to solve bigger and complex problems.
Our ability to build communities, and to trust them, is what made us strong.
We relied, learned, got inspired, and found role models in others.

But now society focus on individuals, not communities.
We forget to nurture the social fabrics that keep humanity.
We end up loosing our ability to trust the other in front of us.

Without trust everything crumbles.
We loose freedom by being afraid to walk, talk or create in public.
We refugee in the comfort of our house and the artificial communities in our phones.
We are spending too much time online.
We are spending too much time alone.

Most people don’t know their neighbors, less so, trust them.

This easy access gives also an easy exit, thus weakening our commitments.
As it is easier to replace something broken rather than fixing it, we are translating that behaivor to our relationships.
We look for easy ways of interacting with others, we look for easy exits, or we don’t even involve ourselves from the start.
We don’t allow ourselves to be truly vulnerable and honest with the other.
There is a happiness and gratification that is only reached b building something for the long run, of working on a relationship for years, with up, downs, and terrible down, and coming together trusting that the other will value us and work on repairing the relation together.

We look for solutions on wellness plans and holistic diets and activities.

But still, these solutions are focused on the individual, not the community.

collective narcissism 
Our community health is as important as our phisycal one.
People are looking for connection.
We see new efforts all over the world of new communities emerging.
Looking for reinvindicating a knwologe not so long forgottedn.
We are here to join that revolution

We see the opportunity awaiting.

In this contex, Club del Sur was born.
We are a group of dreamers and builders who want to restore the social fabrics that unite us.
Our mision is to bridge the physical and mental gaps that separate us.
We aim to create environments that go beyond mere entertainment.
We are creating a playground where we can connect with others who inspire us, have meaningful conversations, and experiment with new ideas.
A space where dialogue and ideas unfold and flourish.
An environment where we can grow as individuals and as a community.

In a world where you can talk with everyone from anywhere in the world.
We choose phisical connection, stability and routine.
We need face-to-face interactions.
We need spaces to gather and share experiences together.
And we need them in a regular basis.
We don’t host standalone events nor virtual events.
All meetings happen on a regular and in-person basis.
We also believe in the power of working in person with others.
We believe in the power of traditions and having a physical space where you can connect in person with others.
Everyone who wants to join the club must be present in mind and body.
We don’t host virtual events nor record our meetings.
We believe in the power of sharing a space together and exchanging non verbal language.

, we don’t do entertainments.
We see the value of entertainment but we don’t organize around it.
There are many options available.
Our focus is to engage in activities that challenge us, that makes us think critically and dialogue, and activities that awaken our curiosity, and get us in action.

We value critical thinking, dialogue, curiosity, and action.

Our city is more than a place for leisure now.
Our community is ready for it’s new ...
At Club del Sur, we welcome you and the other dreamers who want to build the culture for today and for those who are still to come.
