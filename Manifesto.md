## Club del Sur - Manifesto

There comes a time when a city is ripe for change.
We are seeing it in ours.
Punta del Este is a city with the perfect blend of rural lifestyle, wellness, and quality.
With its beautiful nature and slow life, it has attracted the best minds, builders, and entrepreneurs from the region.
Once a vacationing destination, it is now the home of many people living all year round.
In this city, you can find world-class art, exquisite restaurants and great nightlife
Although many entertainment activities are available, there are no activities that challenge the mind.
We crave stimulating conversations

But this is a problem bigger than our city.
In today's world, there is no time for deep conversations.
Society is more concerned with lifestyle and leisure, leaving no space nor time for deep explorations.
We are asigning more value to how things look than their real quality.
We judge people by their job titles and certificates.
We compare people by their followers' counts, likes, or views. 
We spend lot of time entertaining ourselves, addicted to the dopamine our phones feeds. But we are more bored and anxious than ever in history.
Why are we still trapped in these games?

On top of that, we face a new problem: 
Our technologies made our lives easier and more comfortable.
That comfort is fragmenting our communities.
Why would we want to invest in our community if all our necessities can be solved within 3 clicks?
From the comfort of our homes, we can buy goods and food and get them delivered to our doors.
We get to see and chat with our friends and family.
We can take online classes, work and do excersise from our houses.
But this comfort comes with secondary effects 
It is disconnecting us from what makes us feel alive.
We are spending too much time online. 
We are spending too much time alone.
We are loosing our social abilities and connections.
Most people don’t know their neighbors, less so, trust them.
We evolved as social creatures.
Our community health is as important as our phisycal one.
And we’re not taking good care of it.
But our lives are being intermediated by artificial entities, whether an institution called the government or an object called the computer.
We are replacing the effort needed to maintain social connections with apps and institutions.

Our lives are getting shallow and faster but without substance.
We are everywhere, but we are nowhere at the same time.
We are connected with everyone but we are not connecting with our friends.
We are entertained but we are not living a life of purpose.
We look like we are having a good moment, but we are more isolated than ever.
We need face-to-face interactions.
We need spaces to gather and share experiences together.
And we need them in a regular basis.
It is not enough to have a coffe once evry two month to keep a haelthy relationship.

We see the opportunity awaiting.

In this contex Club del Sur was born.
Our mision is to bridge the physical and mental gaps that separate us.
We are dreamers and we are doers.
We aim to create environments that go beyond mere entertainment.
We want to reinvindiacte the value of a strong community.
We want to restore the safe spaces where we can regularly meet and create alongside with others. 
We are creating a playground where we can truly connect with others who inspire us, have meaningful conversations, and experiment with new ideas.
A space where ideas and conversations unfold and flourish.
A space where we can be vulnerable and respected by our comunity
(ver libro you’re invited)

In a world where you can talk with everyone from anywhere in the world.
We value phisical connection, stability and routine.
We believe in the power of traditions and having a physical space where you can connect in person with others.
We don’t host standalone events nor virtual events.
All meetings happen on a regular and in-person basis.
We also believe in the power of working in person with others.

Punta del Este is more than a place for leisure now.
Punta del Este is ready. 
We are ready.
We are a group of people who want to reivindicate the social fabrics that society has forgoten. 
We value critical thinking, dialogue, curiosity, and action.
